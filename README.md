Antiferromagnetic van der Waals layered semiconductors such as transition metal phosphorus sulfides are of great interest due to their unique combination of magnetic, optical, and structural properties. 
The layered structure allows for exfoliation and the study of property changes over the transition from three-dimensional to two-dimensional structures.
The exotic thickness-dependent magnetic orders are influenced by the varying magnetic and structural anisotropies for different materials.
As the selected semiconductors have bandgaps in the optical and near-infrared, optical measurement techniques offer opportunities for fast in situ measurements of the magnetic structure on a limited sample volume.\
In this work, polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy has been identified as the most promising optical measurement technique for studying the magnetic phase transitions in the selected materials.
The magnetic splitting in the photoluminescence line of NiPS$_3$ has been demonstrated to be more complex than previously reported, with varying splitting depending on the linear polarization.
In CrPS$_4$ the circular dichroism of the photoluminescence line was shown to be proportional to the magnetization, allowing the entire magnetic phase diagram to be studied with optical methods.
